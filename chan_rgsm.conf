jbenable = yes			; Enables the use of a jitterbuffer on the receiving side of a

						; be used only if the sending side can create and the receiving
						; side can not accept jitter. The RGSM channel can't accept jitter,
						; thus an enabled jitterbuffer on the receive RGSM side will always
						; be used if the sending side can create jitter.

;jbtargetextra = 40		; This option only affects the jb when 'jbimpl = adaptive' is set.
						; The option represents the number of milliseconds by which the new jitter buffer
						; will pad its size. the default is 40, so without modification, the new
						; jitter buffer will set its size to the jitter value plus 40 milliseconds.
